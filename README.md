Hiya Patrick! I made a little thing:

(Holler if it seems broken; I've only given it the barest sanity check so far.)

Y'all probably have reasons you don't think it makes sense to think of Stripe Capital loans in terms of the equivalent annualized interest rate but it's the first thing I wanted to know when I saw the offer for Beeminder. Mostly it was just fun to work out the math though.

(Actually, it might be kind of amazing to show a little graph in the "select your offer" calculator, showing effective annualized interest as a function of revenue.)

PS: As an example, if we plug in this person's numbers -- https://twitter.com/shaneharter/status/1469041854238785536 -- we can infer that their revenue is $37.9k/mo and their annualized interest for the loan they describe would be 19%.
